Wifi Runs, mostly using Wigle Wifi

This repository contains GeoJSON (and possibly other) files with Wireless Network mappings gathered during various walks. Mos will be in in Timisoara.

Main gathering method is using the Wigle ( [https://wigle.net/](https://wigle.net/) ) Android application. Converted from KML export to GeoJSON using [http://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/](http://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/)

All data is under CC-zero, feel free to use as you wish. Almost all data should already be uploaded to wigle.net.

If you make any nice stats/visualizations please let me know.

If you happen to be in Timisoara and mapping, feel free to open a pull request with more data :)

Random ideas:

- open/secured/WEP/WPA/WPA2 networks
- printers which are completely open (oh yes, there are some ... )
- wireless channel pollution in different areas
